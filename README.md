### What is this?

This is a simple proof-of-concept for React/Typescript.

##### It's easy and fun.

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. profit

I started building a forms library. I'm using ES2015 modules.

I also made sure to try out:
  * interfaces (everywhere)
  * types (almost everywhere)
  * public/private/protected function modifiers (almost everywhere)
  * classes and class extension (everywhere)
  * generic types and class overriding (fields/GenericBaseField)
  * dynamic component state and communication between components

I don't want to overstate the obvious, but this is a serious good stack. I'm barely 
using console and debugger. Almost all errors are caught at compile time. My IDE is 
just humming along with autocompletion and signature popups. I can't wait to throw 
in a testing framework for unit tests.
