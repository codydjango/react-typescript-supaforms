This is a great time to get started with React, ES2015, and Typescript.

Typescript is a superset of Javascript. The "Typeing" is actually optional -- you don't
need to use it if you don't want to. But most will, because the benefit far outweighs
the cost. The tools and IDEs are completely battle-tested and make software development fun
again.


Cody notes to self:
- typescript has "interface", similar to a class
- public in constructor also enables creation of public properties of the same name.
- public/private/protected modifiers; public by default
- get/set function support
- static properties for classes
- abstract classes
- function overloading, constructor overloading
- interfaces
- classes and interfaces play nicely together
